An English to Hindi Neural Machine Translator Model Deployable as a Chrome Extension on your browsers.

# Installation & Set Up
### 1) Clone/ Download the Eng2Hin Project Folder to your local computer.

However, I've added the colab notebook used for training that may be referred to understand how it works.
